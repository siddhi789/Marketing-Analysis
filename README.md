# About:
DB Bank is a large public sector bank that has branches across the cities. It provides various services like savings accounts, current accounts, term deposits, personal loans, home loans etc. to customers. Whenever the bank conducts marketing on its new schemes, it will keep track of data related to customersâ€™ personal, social and economic details. Also, it maintains the detailing on efforts made to achieve success in the campaign. 

Recently, the bank has conducted a campaign to market their term-deposit scheme. Campaigns were conducted based mostly on direct phone calls, soliciting the bank's customers to place a term deposit. After all the marketing efforts, if the client had agreed to place a deposit, then the campaign is a success, otherwise not (Target variable marked 'yes', or 'no').

# Challenges:
It is a challenge for bank officials to target the right people for a successful campaign. The marketing team must analyse various details like profession, income, age, education etc. of the customers. Also, the possibility of any existing loans, credit history etc. will give economic status to the customer and hence helps in understanding whether the person is capable of depositing money into the term-deposit scheme of the bank.
